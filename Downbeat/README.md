Introduction
Game Summary Pitch
I want to make a Deckbuilder + Rhythm game using a set of cards as the perks/difficulties, and having the value of the cards correspond to the amount of notes/different inputs you’ll have to press, anything more than 4 would be a nightmare for me.
		
Inspiration
BALATRO
Main source of inspiration for the primary section of my game, that being UI inspiration, since I personally think the ingame UI is clear, and very nice looking. As well as the main art style inspo, perk inspo, and card theming.

GEOMETRY DASH
Main source of inspiration for the songs, and for the actual gameplay aspect of it due to being so addictively fun! And just a great game in my opinion, fun as rhythm gets.

OSU
A great rhythm game that is incredibly difficult, good inspiration for my own game since it has the vibes, and the difficult, I’ll be going for.

Player Experience
Players will have nightmares. But actually, I want the game to just be pretty fun, but VERY difficult when at the highest point, and at least 1 unique song fully played for all the difficulties in the short time that I have.

Platform
The game is developed to be released on Windows + Linux PC
	
Development Software
–CODING STUFFS–

Genre
Deckbuilder + Rhythm 

Target Audience
I want the target audience to be people just getting into the more difficult side of rhythm games, think base after base sort of difficult in Geometry Dash.

Concept
Gameplay overview
Tap numbers on the keyboard to activate the same number on the card, using special cards to make it either more difficult, or easier with more or less reward, use higher number cards for a more plain out difficult.
Theme Interpretation (Only One)
Only One - Only one of something
Description - Only one card that you have to use to BEAT THE GAME, and only 1 song LOL.

Primary Mechanics

Mechanic
Description
Animated Mockup 
(Art not necessarily final)
Card Clicking 
Everytime you click a specific number on your keyboard, it clicks the number on the card as well (1 = Ace, 2 = 2, and so on), and makes it light up. You have to time the inputs to the falling/moving beats, to the specific card slot


Deck Difficulty 


Every level will have the option to allow you to make the game much more, or less difficult through 2 options.

First - Higher Card Number
Requires more inputs, and more thought process, but gives higher rewards, makes the game go from a 1 button, up to 10 button game

Second - Ability Cards
These are cards that will change the general mechanics, speed, and vibe of the game unlocked by beating certain levels, or certain difficulties



	
Secondary Mechanics

Mechanic
Description
Animated Mockup 
(Art not necessarily final)
Custom Levels
Have to allow people to make custom levels through Steam, and heavily encourage modding


Multiple Game Modes
Tied in with the cards, could allow for multiple game-modes instead of just a single one, and changes core mechanics.




Card Mechanics (Might Change) (General Ideas for now)
Most of the Ideas are stolen from other games

Mechanic

Animated Mockup

Art
Theme Interpretation
Limited colour palette, but has to be very BRIGHT, and very energetic. Likely just going to use the palette from Black Hole Mania with a ton of tweeks, and must use casino-like art, and typical card design.
Design
Bright, very Addictive looking art, that has to stay true to the inspiration of casinos.
Audio
Music
8-Bit pixelated music for my pixelated game, as well as a large variety of songs for all of the different levels.
Sound Effects
Simple, but I want them to have a certain feeling of addictiveness when needed, like just the sound effects themselves have to be very nice to hear.

Game Experience
UI
Pixelated UI showing the bare minimum that it needs to, and squaring off the screen. V How I plan for the screen to be distributed, with the yellow space in the middle, score on the left side, and progression/combo through the level on the right



Controls
Keyboard
	1 - 0 on Keyboard for each number, allow for rebinding though. And Mouse/Arrow keys to navigate menus
Gamepad
	DPAD + Main Face Buttons + R1/L1 to allow for all difficulties to still be available to console… They aren’t gonna have a fun time
